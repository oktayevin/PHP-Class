A gnome in the woods.

This is the story of gnome Jerome. 
A long time ago he lived in a deep and dark forest. It was horrible and chilly and not at all safe for a little gnome!

One day he decided to try his luck with the people. He found a nice little house and installed himself there under the cupboard.
The children in the house soon found his hiding place but liked his presence so much that they made a song about it:

"Oh cute Jerome, cute Jerome,
wiede wiede wall,
squeaky little gnome,
come as I call.

cute Jerome, cute Jerome,
squeaky little gnome,
Wiede wiede wiede wout,
come when I shout."
